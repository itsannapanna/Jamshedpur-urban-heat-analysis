## Problem Statement

Urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activity and infrastructure. This project aims to answer:
* Which wards in Jamshedpur are most affected by the urban heat island effect?
* What is the relationship between temperature, green cover (NDVI), and population density at the ward level?
* Can we create a composite "Heat Risk Score" to identify the most vulnerable areas?

---

## Tech Stack & Data

* **Programming:** Python
* **Libraries:** Geopandas, Pandas, Rasterio, Scikit-learn, Folium
* **Data Sources:**
    * **Satellite Imagery:** Landsat 9 data via Google Earth Engine.
    * **Ward Boundaries:** Extracted from an ArcGIS Web Service.
    * **Census Data:** Scraped from the 2011 Census of India website.

## Key Findings

* A strong negative correlation was found between average temperature and vegetation index (NDVI) at the ward level.
* Wards with high population density and industrial zones showed significantly higher average temperatures.
* A "Heat Risk Score" was calculated, identifying **Sakchi** as one of the most at-risk areas.
